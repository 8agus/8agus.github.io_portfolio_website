<h2 class="gameHead">Command Line Game</h2>

<h3 class="comLineHead">Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<div class="comLineBox">
    <span class="modal">
        <p>To write a tic-tac-toe game that can be played in the command line, you need to be familiar with programming fundamentals such as variables, data types, functions, loops, conditionals, and user input/output. You should also have knowledge of Python programming language, as well as the Python Standard Library.</p>
        <p>The main function sets up the game board, prompts the user to choose their symbol, and begins the game by calling the make_selection function.</p>
        <p>The program uses the choices function from the Python random module to randomly select the computer's move. The setup_board function initializes the game board, and the print_board function displays the board on the screen. The check_for_winner function checks if there is a winner based on the current state of the board.</p>
        <p>The pc_select function is responsible for selecting a random block on the board for the computer. The make_selection function prompts the user to select a block on the board, updates the board with the user's move, and calls the check_for_winner function to see if the user has won. If no winner is found, the function prompts the computer to make its move and continues until a winner is found or the game ends in a tie.</p>
